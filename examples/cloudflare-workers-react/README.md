Example of using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) with:
 - Vite
 - Vike
 - React

> [!NOTE]
> For creating a new Vike app, we recommend using [Bati](https://batijs.dev) instead of copying this example. Because this example uses a custom React integration instead of using `vike-react` which [we generally don't recommend](https://vike.dev/new/core).

## Docs

See [vike.dev/cloudflare-workers](https://vike.dev/cloudflare-workers).


## Run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vikejs/vike
cd vike/examples/cloudflare-workers-react/
npm install
```

Develop:

> For increased development speed, we use Vite's development server instead of a worker.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Preview the worker locally:

> You'll need to login/create a Cloudflare account.

```bash
npm run preview
```

Deploy the worker to Cloudflare:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
