If you get this warning:

```
Client runtime loaded twice
```

Then this means that the page has loaded more than one copy of Vike's client runtime. In other words, the client-side bundle of the page includes Vike's client runtime twice (or more).

In order to reduce the size of your client, make sure that the client-side JavaScript of a given page includes Vike's client runtime only once.

You can, for example with Unix, inspect where Vike's client runtime is included:

```bash
cd dist/client/
grep -r 'loaded twice'
```
