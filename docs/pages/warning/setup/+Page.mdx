[Vite](https://vite.dev) should only be loaded in development (or when building). Loading it in production is unnecessary and significantly bloats the production process.

In production:
- Make sure you don't mistakenly load the [`vite` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite) nor <Link href="/vite-plugin">Vike's Vite plugin</Link> in production.
- Make sure you don't call <Link href="/createDevMiddleware">`createDevMiddleware()`</Link> in production: the development middleware isn't needed in production.
  > You can still import it in production — just make sure you don't call it.
  > ```js
  > // Environment: production
  > import { createDevMiddleware } from 'vike/server' // ✅ You can import it
  > createDevMiddleware()                             // ❌ You shouldn't call it
  > ```

In development, if you use a server without <Link href="/server">`vike-server`</Link>, then make sure to use <Link href="/createDevMiddleware">`createDevMiddleware()`</Link> for adding the development middleware to your server.
