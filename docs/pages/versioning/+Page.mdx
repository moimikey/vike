Vike version updates that keep the leading digit (e.g. `0.4.x` => `0.4.y` or `1.x.y` => `1.z.w`) can be considered non-breaking except of `MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`.


## `MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`

[`MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#minor-breaking-changes) can be introduced in any version update, even patch updates such as `1.2.3` => `1.2.4`.

They affect very few users, and you're unlikely to be one of them. So we recommend that you ignore them — unless updating breaks your app.

> If updating Vike breaks your app, check the [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for any `MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`. If you experience a breaking change that isn't listed, reach out — we'll treat it as a regression and we'll fix it.

> **It significantly speeds up Vike’s development.** For example, it enables Vike to [quickly fix bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22bug%20%3Aboom%3A%22): if Vike behaves incorrectly and fixing it helps almost everyone but breaks the app of very few users, then we prioritize the fix over strict adherence to non-breaking version updates.

## Semver

Vike doesn't strictly follow [semver](https://semver.org): features can be introduced in any version update.


## Deprecation warnings

Vike sometimes adds a warning when an API will be deprecated in the next major release.

You can postpone migrating — the old API and the new API are both supported until the next major release.

> It isn't a breaking change and, therefore, such warnings can be introduced in any version update.
