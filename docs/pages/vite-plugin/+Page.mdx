import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

Environment: development & build-time (Node.js/Deno/Bun)  

```js
// vite.config.js

import vike from 'vike/plugin'

export default {
  // Make sure to include `vike()` and not `vike`
  plugins: [vike()]
}
```

Vike's Vite plugin doesn't have any options. (All <Link href="/settings">Vike settings</Link> are defined in <Link href="/config#files">`+` files</Link>).

It should be loaded only in development or during build, see <Link href="/warning/setup" />.
